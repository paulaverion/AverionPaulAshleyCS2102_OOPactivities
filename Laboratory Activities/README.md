# Laboratory Activity Repository

## Overview
This repository contains several laboratory activities demonstrating Java programming concepts. Each activity focuses on specific topics, such as basic input/output, calculations, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism. These activities serve as practical exercises to reinforce programming skills and demonstrate the application of Java principles in real-world scenarios.

## Activities

### Lab Act 1: Basic Input and ASCII Values
This activity introduces basic user input handling and ASCII value operations.
- **Programs**:
  - `GettingGreater`: Compares two characters based on their ASCII values and displays the greater value.
  - `GettingInputs`: Collects and displays song details (year, genre, album, title, and artist).

### Lab Act 2: Arrays and Loops
This activity demonstrates the use of arrays and loops for numerical calculations.
- **Programs**:
  - `GetArrayMean`: Calculates the mean of an array of integers entered by the user.
  - `MultiplicationTable`: Generates a multiplication table based on user input.

### Lab Act 3: Object-Oriented Programming
This activity explores object-oriented programming concepts, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Programs**:
  - `Artist` and subclasses (`Singer`, `Painter`, `Writer`, `Dancer`): Models various types of artists and displays their attributes.
  - Enum types (`Genre`, `Medium`, `DanceStyle`, `WritingStyle`) are used to categorize specific characteristics of artists.

### Lab Act 4: Polymorphism and Abstract Classes
This activity demonstrates polymorphism and the use of abstract classes to define shapes with shared properties.
- **Programs**:
  - `Shape` (abstract class) and subclasses (`Square`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`): Models different shapes with methods to calculate area and perimeter.
  - `ShapeCollection`: Manages a collection of shapes and displays their properties.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the corresponding folder for the activity you wish to review.
3. Compile and run the Java programs using the following commands:
   ```bash
   javac <filename>.java
   java <classname>
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts for user input where applicable.

## Purpose
These activities are designed to:
- Reinforce understanding of Java basics (e.g., input handling, loops, arrays).
- Practice object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Apply abstract classes and interfaces to solve practical problems.

## Notes
- Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed on your system to compile and run the programs.
- The activities are independent of each other; you can run them in any order.
